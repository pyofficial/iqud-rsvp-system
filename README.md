## 📌 Assignment Progress Update

- Completed whole used level functionality.
- Focused on user-side functionality and UI optimizations (in progress).
- Used Livewire 3 (wire:poll for hot reload) and Bootstrap CDN for styling.
- Explored emit (used in Livewire 2) and dispatch (Livewire 3 property) for event refreshing but faced a small issue.
